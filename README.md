# **Demographics**
Collecting Demographics Information. 
Information are based on NIH demographic report needed. 


## **Motivation**
In the past, our lab let participants fill out dempgraphic information by paper and assign RA manually enterd those information. Creating this demographic collection project mainly because our lab has computers disconnected from internet on purpose, so we are not able to use online survey. Ultimately, this program will significantly reduce human work and error.

# Path
### Study Name
In our lab, all studies are saved in same folder, thus the dropdown list were generated by all the file name in this folder. 
In which needed to be changed in .py file. 
This dropdown list reduce human error when type in study's name. 
### Saving Path
```
# At bottom of .py file
 def allsubmit(self):
        os.chdir("~/finalized_experiments/Demographic"). # change path to change saving path
```
# you can always use psychopy to open/run the file
# Stand Alone Application
If a stand alone application is needed (without open python), run folloing code in terminal. This will create a folder with all the needed modules, so that the script could be run without openning python editor. Or you can simply download the [Demographic](Demographics) folder. In the new folder created by this code, there is a [application with exec icon](Demographics/Demographics) which is the stand Alone Application you will be use.


### To convert the PY file to stand alone application 

Open terminal, install auto-py-exe if you don't have it.
```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
# Set up the working directory (add directory after cd)
cd
```
To convert .py file to a stand alone application.
```
auto-py-to-exe
```
In open window, select the script is needed to be convert. In drop down menu, add picture for icon (optional) 
Press CONVERT .PY TO .EXE at bottom. Output file is now in the working directory.

#### If the Demographics EXE file can't open  
Go to get info for this file, set open through Terminal as default. 

In terminal, type in code, with a space at the end, then type in file path
```
chmod +x 
```
Now you should be able to open this app!
